Ghana GH A?NNN,
A?NNNN, A?NNNNN
Ghana uses a digital address system. A digital address is made up of two main components: a postcode (e.g. EN-200) and a unique address (e.g. 1987). The first letter in the postcode represents a region (E for Eastern Region in this case), the second letter/digit (N) represents the district (N for New Juaben). The next batch of numbers (200) represent the area code. The regional, district and area codes come together to form the postcode. The last batch of numbers (1987) represent the unique address of the location. A combination of the postcode and the unique address make up the digital address.[7]

United Kingdom Phased introduction, from 1966 to 1974. Still in use. GB A[A]N[A/N] A[A]N[A/N] NAA Known as the postcode. The first letter(s) indicate the postal area, such as the town or part of London. Placed on a separate line below the city (or county, if used). The UK postcode is made up of two parts separated by a space. These are known as the outward postcode and the inward postcode. The outward postcode is always one of the following formats: AN, ANN, AAN, AANN, ANA, AANA, AAA. The inward postcode is always formatted as NAA. A valid inward postcode never contains the letters: C, I, K, M, O or V. The British Forces Post Office has a different system, but as of 2012 has also adopted UK-style postcodes that begin with "BF1" for electronic compatibility.
United States US NNNNN NNNNN, NNNNN-NNNN Known as the ZIP Code with five digits 99999* or the ZIP+4 Code with nine digits 99999-9999* (while the minimum requirement is the first five digits, the U.S. Postal Service encourages everyone to use all nine). Also used by the former US Pacific Territories: Federated States of Micronesia; Palau; and the Marshall Islands, as well as in current US territories American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. An individual delivery point may be represented as an 11-digit number, but these are usually represented by Intelligent Mail barcode or formerly POSTNET bar code.
The first digit is assigned regionally (for example, ZIP codes beginning with 9 are found in the western coastal states, Alaska, Hawaii, and islands in the Pacific), and ZIP codes with the same first three digits are served by the same USPS sorting facility (which sometimes serve multiple such groupings), so will be geographically clustered (for example, all ZIP codes in 919XX, 920XX, and 921XX are found in San Diego County, California).
